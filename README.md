In this paper, we employed the Freely-Jointed Chain (FJC)
model to investigate the statistical properties of the polymeric
chain. By fixing the number of conformations (T) and varying
the number of monomers from 10 to 1000, we determined the
mean square end-to-end distance and mean square radius of gyration, validating the results through theoretical linear fitting. Additionally, for a fixed number of monomers and conformations,
we analyzed the probability distribution of end-to-end distance,
observing a Lorentzian shape. Singular behavior in the distribution was verified for short monomer chains. In the final part,
we explored the structure factor I as a function of wave vector (k)
for fixed conformations and monomer numbers, comparing it to
the Guinier approximation
